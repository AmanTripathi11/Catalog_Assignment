This project implements Lagrange interpolation to find the constant term of a polynomial defined by given roots, utilizing JavaScript and the Node.js environment. It reads input data from a separate JSON file and checks various constraints regarding polynomial coefficients.

## Features

- Decodes values from different bases.
- Computes the constant term using Lagrange interpolation.
- Validates polynomial coefficients based on given constraints.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

## Installation

1. **Run the Application:**
   
   Use the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   npm init -y
   npm i fs
   node index.js
